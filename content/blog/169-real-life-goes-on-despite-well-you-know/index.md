Decisions decisions decisions decisions...oh sorry...thinking out loud. Today and possibly tomorrow and maybe even the next two days are days of making decisions.
I would like to think that it was going to be easy but there is always some little issue, some nagging detail, some microscopic "what if" that throws the whole thing into chaos....making the easiest decision a life changing one...maybe I exaggerate a little.
There are many voices...mostly the ones in my head...sharing their opinions...but I think there are really only 3 I should listen to and then narrow it down to two and then one and then...well, then I will fill with doubt and start over. That's how I roll.

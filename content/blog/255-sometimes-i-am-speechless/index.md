To understand this blog entry you will have to go back and read my entry about the dragonfly.

It's about 1:30 pm and I am in the check out line at Michael's craft store. 
There is a older woman in front of me...she stood there with her back to me for a minute.... suddenly she turned around...."Do you need this dragonfly?" she asks....
"Yes I do" I reply as she hands me a dragonfly paper punch and turns back around.

I turned to tell my friend Traci who had just joined me in the line and when I turned back around she was gone. Maybe she went to the car, maybe she went to the bathroom....maybe..............

I am speechless.

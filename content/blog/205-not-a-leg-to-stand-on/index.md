I still don't really have a leg to stand on. The pain in my left knee is causing me to walk funny with my cane, which is in turn causing my right knee to hurt too.
Bugga'!

I do have a call in to the Dr. to ask about a knee brace. Still haven't heard.

Did anyone watch "24" last night? Now THAT'S a relaxing show.

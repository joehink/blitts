I have spent the last few days pondering a new question...maybe it is more of a thought....no, it's a question. My mind has phrased it in several ways such as.....
What am I supposed to do now? Am I parent or patient? Do my kids even need me around much? What am I accomplishing? Where do I fit?

A lot of things have changed around here and I now I don't know where to park myself anymore.

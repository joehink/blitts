This scene in Mission Impossible is the only one I remember...oh and something on a train....when I woke up this morning this scene popped into my head. It really summarizes how I am feeling right now.....I am not sure whether I have just avoided a catastrophe or about to get in one.....so I am just holding my breath and waiting. 
Hopefully I will have test results by Monday.....

Bum bum bum bum,bum bum bum bum....dedle eee dedle eee dedle eee bud dum!

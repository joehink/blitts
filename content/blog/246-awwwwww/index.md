Ok people....how cute is that???



And that?

I am putting together a book for a few family members, so I spent much of this past weekend going through many many many many many pictures and then scanning and scanning and scanning and scanning....it was enough to make a girl eat too much leftover Halloween candy in her delirium.

It also brought back a lot of memories...lots of good ones....some bad....(mostly because I thought I was 50 lbs lighter than I was...or I had made a very bad hair decision).

It also made me think of what I might have done differently....it's too bad we don't figure it out until after our back to back counseling appointments with our kids....but I suppose it is never too late to start.

Believe it or not I am in Chicago. It was a gutsy move I must admit considering my anemic state.....but it's not like I walked here. I have done much sitting and visiting with fabulous Aunt's, Uncle, and cousins and it has been great. Oh I could fall asleep at any time but they are doing their best to keep me awake. 

I will resume blog entries when I am home Monday.

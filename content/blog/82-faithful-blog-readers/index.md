Dear faithful blog readers,

Thank you for your faithful faithfulness as you faithfully read my blog. 
Over the next 3 days I am not touching my keyboard. My fingers are going to be out of town.
I would love to hear from you anyway. You see, my ears or is it my eyes...either way parts of me, especially my heart will still be with you!!

Happy hot weather.

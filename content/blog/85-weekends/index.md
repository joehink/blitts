Weekends look much different at our house these days. This past weekend Joe was escorted by his Grandfather and a retired NFL player, who played for both the Miami Dolphins and the Seahawks, to the Seahawks new facility. With his VIP pass he was able to watch practice down on the field, he met some great guys and had a great time minus the rain. Joe even ended up with and injury on the sideline but I will let him tell that story himself...

Then it was off to Five Guys Burgers and Fries for dinner with said escorts. "It's like being in New York" Joe said, even though he has never been to New York. The line was long and you yell your order from the line to the guy at the counter who then yells it to the cooks and then you sit and hope for no cheese or tomato.

So this weekend's silver lining is.....learning to hang on to the good times, Five Guy's Burgers are huge, and be careful with that umbrella.

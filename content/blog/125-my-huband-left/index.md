There is no picture to go with this blog tonight. It's better to leave a hole there for now I suppose.
Tonight my husband left. He said that everyone has the right to be happy so he wants his shot at being happy. He took off his wedding ring, filled a hefty bag full of clothes and left. 

I really have nothing more to add tonight...maybe tomorrow. Tonight is about the kids.

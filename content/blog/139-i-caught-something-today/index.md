I love the show Deadliest Catch. Today I "caught" a glimpse of Nick Mavar ( the guy farthest to your left) while I was at the grocery store. More than a glimpse actually....several glimpses if you must know. 

He lives here in town. Our town is pretty small so you would think that after living here 12 years I would would have seen him around. Nope...today was the first time.

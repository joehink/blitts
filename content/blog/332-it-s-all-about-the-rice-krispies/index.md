Well I am writing when I can…..I struggled with how I am going to say this because I didn’t want to sound like I was complaining…..sick is now the operative word. The only thing I can do now is just concentrate on the number of days I have left. Two more days this week and 5 next week. But it’s hour to hour now. It’s all about the Rice Krispies.

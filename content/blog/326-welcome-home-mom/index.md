I am Home!!!!!!!! Finally home.....I came home to streamers and banners and balloons and kid kisses and cats and a dog and neighbors who I love. How healing is that?!

Now I am awake and it is the middle of the night..... but it's just the rush of it all.....all the sounds of the house are the same and it is so comforting to hear.

You forget sometimes what it sounds like when the furnace comes on and it humms you back to sleep when you have just a tiny chill, or the clock in the bedroom that ticks and like a baby in a cradle it lulls you into that sleepy fog.

Now that I have said all of that, I should try and go back to sleep. I was just so glad to be home!

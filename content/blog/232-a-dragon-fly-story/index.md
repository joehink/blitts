Once upon a time there was a girl with cancer. She was facing a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. She spent the whole day at the Dr's office having treatment after treatment. When she left the sky was dark and so was her mood. 

Walking in the door she felt the need to check her e-mail right away. She was surprised to see that her sister, who lives in Poland, had sent her a picture. She opened the email and there, larger than life, was a huge dragonfly. 

"Wow" she thought. "This is amazing timing." I really needed that encouragement right now.

It wasn't until the next day that she learned her sister had attempted to send that picture several times that day, before finally deciding to wait and send it in the morning.

At 11:00 pm(Polish Standard Time) unable to sleep, she got up, turned on the computer, and sent the picture with no problem. Moments later it was opened on the other side of the planet where her sister was hurting....perfect timing.

Had that picture arrived the day before, or even the day after...it would not have had the same impact.

God knows.....and that's huge.

If I were to describe how life feels right now this is it! The only difference would be that I would be pedaling the bike AND crying...occasionally I would throw in some gnashing of teeth for stress relief and style points. 

The truth is that I am still loved despite it and for reasons of undeserved mercy, I reach today's destination. Can I hear an AMEN?

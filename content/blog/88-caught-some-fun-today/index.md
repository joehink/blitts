I love Deadliest Catch...whose with me?! 
Several of the deckhands on the show, live in Anacortes.
Today Joe and I headed out to have lunch and run a few errands. On the way home we passed Edgar Hansen waving a sign for the Deadliest Catch car wash. It was to raise money for one of the deckhands who's father went missing in January. 

So the three of us, Joe, Olive Oyl (my car) and I, went through the wash. So many friends and family members sprayed and scrubbed and rinsed and dried. It was so great to see the families all smiling and laughing. 

As I pulled the car around, Edgar climbed up on the hood and I snapped his picture.
Joe was a bit embarrassed and I drove home with a clean car and a huge smile.

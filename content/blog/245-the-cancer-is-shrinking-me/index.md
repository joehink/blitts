As I was going through all the pictures last weekend, I ran across this one.
After I had spent a few minutes trying to remember where I was going....why I thought to put my hair in a bun....why I chose that blouse against my pasty skin...and how old my brother was at the time....I saw my neck....my normal length,regular person neck. Those were the days when I could wear a necklace without it looking like a choker....when there was space between my bottom ribs and my pelvis...(sorry) so I could wear a belt or tuck in something.
As a tear dropped on to the keyboard, I realized those days are gone.

Love your forever spine compacting friend.

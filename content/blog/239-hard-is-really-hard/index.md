A friend of mine, who is going through a battle of her own, asked me this morning...
"Why does it have to be so hard?
I would have rathered she asked me out to lunch...or to a movie, or even for a solution to global political unrest.... I thought for a second and couldn't come up with one brilliant thing to say. 
The only thing I can really say to that is that we were never promised a life minus the hard stuff....Some of us get it and some don't. I wish I were in the "don't" category more often but it is what it is. 

Then this thought struck me (after we hung up of course) Think of what the world would be like with our propensities as humans and no hardship to temper it. Would there be a good one left among us?

I am always looking for pictures for the blog. I look and look until I find one that screams to me "I'm it! It's me! I am the picture you were looking for!"
Today I found this one. The minute I saw it I was the one screaming "This is it! This is me! This is just how I am feeling"
Life is short but it sure is long isn't it?

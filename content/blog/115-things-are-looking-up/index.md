Things are looking up here. The kids and I have been coming up with ways to move forward and so far we are doing really well...surprisingly well. We worked with the Parks and Rec department and Joe is excited to volunteer with them all summer. Emily is looking for a job but in the meantime she is helping me out. For the most part, peace reigns. Laughter between the three of us is common now. Emily and I have a great gal that we are talking with and Joe has a terrific guy here in town that loves to work with guys his age in a very "outside the box " way. 
Emily is excited because she can bring her dog Jack with her and Joe is looking forward to a new start this summer as he heads to High School in a few months. 

We are doing the best with what we have and it is amazing how things are falling into place.

Peach facts to enhance your life.....
Prunus Persica or peaches, they say, originated in China. They are symbols of abundance and protection. So far I am loving the peach. They are also said to be symbols of affection. The peach is bursting with vitamin A and C and E, and if you can handle more good news, they are good for your skin!!! I say, who CAN'T love a peach?

So today I ate a peach. With every bite I felt abundance and protection. Seriously. Maybe it wasn't because of the peach itself, but I felt it!
I also felt like telling my kids..."You're a peach" which I did and my son smiled and my daughter looked at me funny.

Today, peaches became part of the healing process and I ain't turning back. In fact, here is my gift to you today...in case you need some healing yourself.

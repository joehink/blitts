This entry is going to be a hard one for me. 

With dad (my husband) gone, the 4th of July looks much different this year. Traditional celebration is too painful. My son asked for a change of scenery to avoid painful reminders. So we packed up and headed to Grandma and Grandpa. At Grandma's house there is French Toast, entertainment, golf, someone to pick up after you, provide snacks without restriction and cozy beds where you can sleep forever if you want.

Time with extended family is part of the plan as well. We are looking forward to that.
It is not our first choice, as I am sure you can imagine, but it is a great soft place to land for a few days.

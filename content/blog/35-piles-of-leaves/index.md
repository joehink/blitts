I love the leaves this time of year. Our backyard is full of Alder trees and Maple trees. The leaves are beautiful.
I love the change of seasons, and because of that thought my mind went immediately to how life has seasons too. 

If I were to describe my season, it would be some time in February....dark and blustery. You wonder if the rain will ever end. Then I thought a little more about it and realized that February prepares everything for March, April and May....when the sun comes out and the flowers grow and bloom.

So I guess that is how I will think as the days now get dark and stormy....we will talk about the weeds later so as not to ruin the mood.

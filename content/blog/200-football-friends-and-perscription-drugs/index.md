Today is HINKBOWL...you can look it up online at www.hinkball.com
my husband's creation. 
HINKBOWL brings old friends together for one day a year. There is food guaranteed to give you instant heartburn, pointless men's conversation necessary for the survival of the male species, loudness and laughing...lots of laughing.
It's an oddly fun day...even for me. I have known these guys for years...a GREAT group of men that care about Chad and me and our kids. For them I will take all three of the painkillers so that I can hobble out of my room every so often to participate in a very loud, very sarcastic, very competetive, very rediculous, very necessary event.

Two days ago I voluntarily chose to have a BIG scan...a Pet CT they call it. It is the mother of scans as we know them. I volunteered to have it because I had reason to believe that the results were going to be mind boggling. But the Big scan showed little improvement. It's only result really was making me mad and a small loss of hope...which I am sure will pass...at some point..eventually...possibly...or come to think of it maybe not at all. At least that is how I feel today.
Well, if you will excuse me I have to pour myself some coffee and beat my head against a wall....softly...so it won't crack...it will probably be very unsatisfying.
Have a great day.

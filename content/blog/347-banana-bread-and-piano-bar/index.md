I have sprung free from the "joint" finally. It feels good I have to say, and I have found deluxe accommodations for the infirmed at a home in Edmonds that serves everything you need until 10pm at which time one of the owners goes "pumpkin" and the other "night owl". 

They do offer a lovely late night banana bread at their piano bar where the piano player is now softly playing a Tony Bennett tune. 
The ice water is cold here, just how I like it, and I have a running tab.....
Goodnight.

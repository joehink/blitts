This is a very sad and a very happy day. Today my baby Forest Jump becomes my dear friend Ruth's baby. I love Forest and I love Ruth and to add some freaky to this love fest...he will be living in the exact field that his mom Holly and his dad Paxim did the whoop-de-doo in. Yikes! 

It is sad to push my baby out of the nest but it is great that he will only be a ferry ride away. Bye Forest...Mommy loves you!!!

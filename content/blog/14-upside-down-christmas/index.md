Christmas this year looks upside down. There doesn't seem to be the same level of excitement about much of anything. Nothing about Christmas this year will look the same other than the tree, and even that is difficult as we hang the ornaments that have so many stories behind them. There will only be 2 stockings and that will be weird.

Maybe I'll just wrap a bunch of empty boxes just for looks....ouch...maybe not..
Well, I am doing my best with cookies and as many smiles as I can give, and again I think of "It's a Wonderful Life" and how you really don't know what you got until it isn't there anymore. That is one awfully big empty box under my tree.

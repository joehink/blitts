During this "cancer" phase of my life I have tried hard not to complain....that is a very slippery slope leading to nothing but anger, frustration, abandonment, avoidance, fed-up-edness and call screening by all my friends and family.

So on this rare occasion I have to say, "OUCH..MY KNEE HURTS"

If any of you would like to start a vigil, or 3-day walk, or even just a quick prayer on your way to work (eyes open of course) I would be so humbly grateful and vow (*all vows are subject to change without notice) not to complain any more.

Thank you

I would love to do something with my hands since I have to stay off my feet to allow my knees to heal...wow that's a lot of body parts. I really want to learn to crochet. Not the grandma kind but the scarf kind. Something that requires very little thought because very little thoughts require very little thinking and that is right up my alley right now.
I have a how to book, and I have looked on You Tube but it seems I am not as smart as I look. I need a crochet tutor.
So the quest is on to find a teacher of the lost art of crochet.

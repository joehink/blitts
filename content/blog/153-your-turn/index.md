Just out of curiosity....what would your perfect day look like?

I can't wait to read your answers : )

My perfect day..... A warm (no calorie)buttery gooey cinnamon roll and coffee for breakfast, followed by my Dr. informing me that my cancer is gone, followed by a long ride on Holly, lasagna for dinner, then roasting marshmallows outside with friends and family at my yet to exist gorgeous fire pit.

I have other versions of the perfect day but this is a good starting point.

My puffy ankle has an appointment at the Dr. on Thursday and again on Friday. 
I have to go with her because she really doesn't like going to the Dr. alone. 
For the past few months she has been feeling bloated and uncomfortable. She dug around on the internet and tried a few home remedies, but they just haven't worked for her. She has even given support garments a try and they just....well I don't want to embarrass her...they cause her to have a little muffin top just below the knee....she really doesn't want anyone to know about that...she's a bit self-conscious.
We are hoping that the Dr. will prescribe a little massage as a cure for her "puffiness". An ankle can dream can't she?

In our house there is an empty space where my husband used to be....a manhole if you will...
Although my son's instinct is to try and fill that space, he is only 14 and too young to take that on. And just because my daughter loves monster trucks and Nascar, that doesn't mean she is the man for the job either.

So I guess that leaves me....as it should... you can call me "mad" (that would be mom+dad) or you could call me "dam" (dad+mom). Oh the irony.

Honestly, I don't like being the man...I wasn't made to be the man. So...as a result of this new dynamic, I will henceforth be turning over my man-duties to "The Man".

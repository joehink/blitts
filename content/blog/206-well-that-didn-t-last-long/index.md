Yesterday I was talking about being the bird...free of worry and living life a day at a time, trusting and hoping while I perched myself at home.

Well today I don't feel anything like that perky little bird that is singing it's heart out despite the cat that is eyeballing it from behind the fence post. In fact, where is that pellet gun anyway?............
Today I feel like "Snortzy" and all I want to do is wallow.
I am just trying to keep it real people. No one is perfect and this is a long hard road...I am just trying to walk it truthfully and with some grace.
So I still believe what I said yesterday about the bird...however, I am going to do the pig thing until about noon and then "letitgo"

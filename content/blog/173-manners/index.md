Yesterday, or should I say last night, there was an incident....a rather large incident I am sorry to say....big enough for me to miss watching American idol. It had to do with using good manners....and common decency....and expectations....a dangerous combination as I have discovered. Such a reminder that real life still goes on despite the cancer.

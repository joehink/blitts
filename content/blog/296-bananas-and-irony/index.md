First let me start by apologizing to Forest and Holly for blaming them for my fatigue...well, them and Chad as he has been on a real snoring jag the last few nights....

I just arrived home from the Dr. and my red blood cell count is low aka anemia. I was looking online for foods I could eat to help my body make more red blood cells so it looks like as soon as I am done typing this I am off to the kitchen for a banana. Tomorrow I will work on other foods but tonight I am tired.....ironic huh?

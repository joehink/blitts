I was sitting and thinking...actually I was drinking coffee and eating a cookie...
I was thinking about everyone who reads my blog. I wish I could drink coffee and eat a cookie with each one of you and get to know you better. I would have the single shot Americano with room for milk and a molasses cookie and you would have a double tall pumpkin latte with?
So here in lies the reason for today's blog. Questions. I would, on occassion, like to ask you all a few questions...starting with the question above. I would love to know you all better.
Today's second question is...what is your favorite ice cream?
Mine is Ben and Jerry's Coconut Seven Layer Bar

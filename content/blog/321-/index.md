Ok take all the worst parts of an MRI and then take all the worst parts of a CT scan and put them together and call it a PET scan.... There's the IV part and the sitting "ABSOLUTELY" still for one hour BEFORE the scan, then the drinking two 16oz jugs of congeal-y liquid that in no way tastes like the fruits of the forest which it proclaims, then the iodine injection that makes you feel like you have soiled yourself then there's the tiny tube which they love to call a donut because, I guess, that is supposed to make it more fun, but it's tiny and you are trapped in it for 30 minutes with your arms up over your head, which ain't no fun I assure you, donut or no donut.....

So there you have it. It's done and done thoroughly. Now we wait for the results.

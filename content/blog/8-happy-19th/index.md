Happy 3 days after Christmas and Happy Birthday to my 19yr old daughter...Wait! Did I just say 19?! Wow. 
Dearest daughter of mine, I wish you wonderful things for this year to come. Life can be both exciting and scary at 19, but you are surrounded by those who love you and will help in any way they can.

That being said, please pick up all your stuff and put it in your room. Just kidding. You can do that later after you clean the kitchen. Still kidding. Today is your day so sleep to your heart's content. Be sure you wake up later for some cake.

Love,
Mom

Please, don't anyone miss the chance to say I LOVE YOU today! Say it to your dog, your kids, your spouse, your neighbor's and friends, the grocery clerk, your horses, the policeman who pulls you over because you were hurrying home to say I love you to someone. You never know what tomorrow holds , but today you can say it...so SAY IT!

Tonight for the first time in a while I cried.....really cried....sloppy, runny nose, snarfy overflowing tearduct crying kind of cried. There are so many reasons why this happened...some very good and some rotten, some revealing and some secret and some I am sure, directly related to chemical menopause.
 
It felt so good. I mean really good. The tears really wanted out and now that I am back at my folks there was no reason not to let them. With my dad playing the piano soft and low upstairs it was almost like a scene out of a movie.....kinda cool. 
Well, that's all....I cried....big news....I wonder where our tears are stored?

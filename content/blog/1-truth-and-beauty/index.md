Our Laura Jane is now holding hands with Jesus.

The day after her last post, she did make it to the hospital for treatment and surgery involving her lungs.  In the process, doctors discovered the cancer spread much further than anyone realized.  All expected her to bounce back from surgery and begin more aggressive chemo.  But for no apparent reason her liver failed after the surgery.

As she slowly faded from this world over the next several days, she was surrounded by love.  Friends held her hands and recounted fun adventures together.  Her precious children, Emily and Joe, heard directly from their mother how incredibly much she loved both of them.  And in an amazing show of God's grace, Laura Jane's husband returned home and she and Chad expressed their love for eachother.

She was a picture of courage and strength in her final week with us.  She slipped into the arms of Jesus full of peace in her heart and joy on her face in the first hour of Saturday, January 22, 2011.

Laura Jane's family wants to thank each of you, whether you knew her in person or merely online, for entering into the beauty of this true story.  And we invite you to post a comment to let us and others know how her story has touched you.

To God be the glory.

This is what today looks like. Wait, I take that back. This is what getting out of bed looks like today. Enough said. But look at me all sitting at the computer and talking with you. I DID IT! I GOT OUT OF BED! It's nothing but a small miracle. I am now going to celebrate by taking another vitamin C and attempting to put on my wig and say hello to the world outside. I think I feel my blood beginning to sludge through my veins. It appears I may even have it in me to make some coffee. Oh the possibilities.....

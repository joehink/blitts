Here, in this picture, is a glimpse into my brain of how life looks to me right now. In an odd way there is beauty, but it looks a little scary too...says the person that thinks someone or something is going to leap out of nowhere and get you...a disgusting spider or a bee or a snake or a dude with a mask and a kitchen knife....

In this picture you can't see very far ahead ...not a big fan of that either!

I really really really wish I could walk this trail and not be afraid of anything. 
I am pressing on toward that goal. Wanna come with me?

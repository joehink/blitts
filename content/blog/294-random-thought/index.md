On top of all the other issues to deal with every day, this muscle spasm in my neck is just....arrrrggghh...it's just....rrrrrrrr.....(insert descriptive word here)....
annoying. It is uncomfortable and makes it hard to stand, sit, sleep, drive, walk, talk, back out of the Safeway parking lot, keep my arms at my side, type, gripe, and drink coffee...to name just a few. 

But............when I woke up this morning all I could hear were birds. It was amazing. For a few minutes I forgot about my neck and just listened to the birds and the breeze and the wind chimes. 

Ok, now I can go back to whining about my neck....

Ok, sorry....I have to say "something" about Michael Jackson today. Sorry sorry sorry...It's just so weird to have him gone. I suppose for you older folks it would be like when B-B-B-Bing Crosby died. No? Ok, it was just a guess. 

Anyway, as far back as my music memory goes, Michael was there....that's all I am saying....it's just weird...

Ok I'm going now...have to download some music...nothing by Michael Jackson mind you.. just a few other songs....

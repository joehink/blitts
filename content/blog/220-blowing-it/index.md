Every day...more and more...I realize that I have no control...kids, health, life, people in my life, weather, finances, gas prices, untimely blemishes..."Do I have milk? Do I need milk?" 

The beauty in this true story is that it although it is scary to admit that you have zero control....it sure takes the "Boy, I really blew it" out of life.

AAAhhhhhhccchoooooooooooooo! Bless me!

Foods that heal............sure I am eating fresh fruits and veggies...a lot more now sadly, but then there are the real foods that heal.....yesterday's foods that heal were a Marion berry scone from Penguin coffee in Anacortes...and for lunch, an Oriental Chicken Salad from Applebee's pick up. These were truly foods that heal. Oh ya there are more.....the pecan pie that Sue took to Chad for his birthday when I couldn't be there to do it....and the casserole they ate for dinner last night....and the cake Chad's mom made for him.... the $5 Em got for lunch yesterday when she ran out of lunch money.....all foods that heal in my book!

It's almost 7am and my stummy is now feeling the need for some foods that heal after all this.....thanks you guys that I am not going "hungry"....thank you thank you thank you!

We, in the Pacific Northwest, are about to have a long "streak" of hot weather....no pun intended...yes there was, who am I kidding?! Our 7 day forecast shows mid 90's which translates into wilting....melting...laying on the tile floor surrounded by fans for those of us not used to temperatures that resemble the gates of hell.

So this picture is now going to be my screen saver for the next few days and we will see how well the mind-body connection works to cool me off while staring at it...drinking ice water...sitting on an ice pack...with my feet in a bucket of ice....maybe that's considered cheating...

Well wishes to all of you in the greater Seattle area...stay cool.....and don't get too hot either : ) (oh brother that was corny)

I hit the road again for another week of treatment. I am not whining mind you. I know there are some who would gladly make the drive everyday if they could only find a job. So no whining here. 
How about complaining? Is complaining allowed? Ok, I guess not....even if it was allowed I would really have no reason to complain. I will be spending the morning and/or afternoon with a good friend and who can complain about that? Not me. 

So, as there is no further information other than I am on the road again, I will go and have my 2nd cup of coffee and be thankful even if we do have to drive 3+ hours for a 5 minute treatment. Dang! I'm sorry, it just slipped out.

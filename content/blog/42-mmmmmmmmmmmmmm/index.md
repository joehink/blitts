There is only one solution to having no control over anything in your life...including the headache that has decided to reside over your right eyebrow and occasionally travel down the side of your head despite the two Aleve you took with your coffee. 

That solution is to bake cookies. Not just any cookie mind you....but Oatmeal Scotchies. Holy best cookies ever after molasses, shortbread and lemon bars Batman! 
Is not everyone on the planet happier whilst eating an oatmeal scotchie? I would say the answer to that is an unmistakable YES!.

Thank you Quaker Oats and Nestle for merging together with some butter and eggs to form this delicious solution to life's daily struggles.

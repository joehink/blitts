White whispers rise

Prayers like raindrops in reverse ascend

Angels kneel on Heaven's brim

Arms wide open with the weight of them

Deliver them to the lap of God

Who opens each one and hears their voice

Each one pleading for another

Some who know her and some who don't

Which leaves her speechless as she rests

Upon these prayers like a feather nest


LH 7/09


Thank you everyone for your prayers

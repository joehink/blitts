So we are here.....the Hardley Davidson chicks have made it to Spokane. The weather is fabulous...sorry.....we finally decided to go to dinner at about 8:30 and it was 77*.... that wasn't even our high in Anacortes....anyway it was lovely to say the least.

Most of the day was spent laughing and listening to music on the way over.....overly commenting (on my part) on how desert-y it really was....and just a little shopping and eating and buying of mid-day caffeine products.
The GPS in the Lexus got us to the hotel and we hauled our gear to room 325....stopping for complimentary cookies in the lobby....Lynn filled the ice bucket and we took a break from the car for an hour before heading to dinner.
 
After dinner we drove around town a bit, then back to the Pheasant Hill Inn grabbing some herbal tea before heading back to the room...

We put both of our brains together and came up with enough of one brain to get the laptop connected and here I am.

I don't know for sure what the plan is for tomorrow but isn't that the point of the girly road trip.....

Ok well Thelma is busy texting so Louise is going to hit the loo to slip into her Pj's and climb into her giant princess and the pea bed.
Will write tomorrow.

Well, here I am again.....parked in front of the computer at 3:18 a.m.!!!!!!!!!!!! Good grief!!!!!!!!! Looking up song lyrics of all things...what's that about? I'll tell you what it's about.

The strangest things are waking me up in the middle of the night. For the last few nights it has been songs running through my head when suddenly I stumble over the lyrics and it's so darn upsetting that it wakes me up. I knew I shouldn't have watched the country music awards last night....at least now I know the name of Brad Paisley's teacher that "polished him until he shined". 

And two nights ago it was Jewell.......she called me and she had so many questions, 30 minutes worth if we really talked from the time I got back from the bathroom and when I woke up for the 4th time.
The frustrating thing is I can't blame the steroids any more because I am not taking them...and Chad hasn't snored for weeks (which has been awesome by the way)....so I just lay there.....sometimes I stew about everything.....sometimes I get mad all over again....sometimes the shock of all of this floats back over me....sometimes I pray....so FYI if you have any requests that you would like some middle of the night attention I am your gal.

Sooooooooooo, I'm gonna go now because I still have to look up the name of the 4th gal on the re-make of Lady Marmalade....you know, just in case Christina calls me when I fall back asleep!

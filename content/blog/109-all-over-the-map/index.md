Sorry for the late entry. Today has been all over the map. It is interesting when you release control over your day what can happen. The most amazing of which my daughter started a short stint at summer school which she didn't find out about until 8:00am this morning. I anticipated the equivalent of a small nuclear disaster but she got up and got dressed and went without a whine.
Bravo girl! I spent the morning at the hospital with a friend and her parents, I had a long talk with another dear friend, caught up with yet another friend, the kids took off to run errands and the day is only half over.
Oh the possibilities. : )

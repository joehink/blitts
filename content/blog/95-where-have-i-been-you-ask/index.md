Last week the kids and I headed to Grandma and Grandpa's house. I was scheduled to go to a conference all weekend and the kids were scheduled to be entertained and fed and catered to all weekend. 

Welllllllllll.....Mom and I both ended up with back spasms. Holy donuts they hurt and they annoy and they kinda ruin your chance to attend the whole conference. 
I did, however, meet some great people and I am very thankful for that. 
There was a moment when Emily's schedule and my pain didn't line up. That was not a good moment...but we worked it out. She got home in time to do everything she needed to do and I took another dose of muscle relaxers. I still have a lot to work on with her. I need to find a book titled: "How to parent your 18yr old with Asperger's who wants it all" 

The silver lining is that she and I had a good talk, we both learned some things that will help each other in the upcoming years and we both have counseling appointments next week. We'll make it......nothing is impossible.

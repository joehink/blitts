Many times in life we experience a situation which is both good and bad i.e. cotton candy....tastes good/bad for you. Or there is the root canal...horrible/good for you.
Or even the snake bite you got while on vacation in Eastern Washington while you were walking back to the RV you saved for, for 2 years just to rent it for a week and relax. You had to get a shot of anti-venom/saved your life.

We all have had events like this in our lives. Maybe they all don't last for 3+ years but it's the same outcome.

Here is my latest....husband leaves/I get to watch my incredible son as he goes through this....painful/proud...amazing!

Just a quickie since it's dinner time and stuff...
I made two connections in the last two days . The first was a very good, very awesome (we were friends in the 80's) very special friend...so special in fact that she was a bridesmaid in my wedding. We haven't seen eachother in at least 10 years. We had dinner and laughed hard for 3 hours killing approximately 10,467 cancer cells.

Then today...a phone call from a woman I have known but never met and never spoken to. A fabulous woman who I hope to stay in touch with for years to come...we talked and laughed for 45 min...discussing our lives and stories. This connection killed 8,723 cancer cells only because it was a little shorter visit....making a total of 19,190 total cancer cells on their way out!

Thank you ladies

This is me before my blood transfusion......



This is me after!!!

Earlier this week I went to the hospital, where they seated me in a recliner, inserted an IV, and gave me two units of blood....beautiful...glorious....wonderful red blood cells. Thank you healthy blood donor, you have changed my days..there is nothing as healing as the blood!

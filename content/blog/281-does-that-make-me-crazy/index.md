"I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place.
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space"

This is from Gnarls Barkleys song "Crazy"....a song I will be singing a bit louder when it rotates up on my i-pod next time...
I don't know if it was the radiation or the IV junk or the multitude of pills I have taken or age....but unless it is written down, I don't remember it....and even then it's dicey!

Gotta go call Ken about some hay now....wait what was I going to do? Oh ya more coffee...no that wasn't it.

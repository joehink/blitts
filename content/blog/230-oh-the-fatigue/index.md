Today was my 5th day of radiation. 7 times the machine shifted and rotated and radiated for my jaw.  Then I was spun around on the table so they could radiate my knee...which now has a bright green box around it.

The familiar  fatigue is setting in. This morning I didn't want to get out of bed, or brush my teeth, or pack for the week, or pay attention when I drove, or microwave my coffee......here we go again!

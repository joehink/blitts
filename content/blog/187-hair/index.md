I mentioned the other day about going to a hair appointment....kind of a combination consultation, cut-ish, counseling, humiliating, semi pointless appointment.
It was all of the above. 
We consulted a little, cut a little, I was humiliated a little, and it was a little less than semi-pointless. 
Things looked better on the way home though it was still hidden under the wig. I think most of all it helped me feel a bit feminine again....not so much like a science project. That should be good for something I would think.

Snow is so beautiful. I love the way it looks when it falls..I love the way it covers everything and makes it all look so clean. I love how quiet it is outside when it snows... But I hate it when it falls on Dr's appointment day. Especially when your going to need to have your lung tapped and the next available appointment is over a week away.
And further more, they say that no two snowflakes are alike....I'm not so sure....how do they know that a snowflake that fell in the 1800's doesn't look like the one that fell in my back yard yesterday? Hmmmm, what are your thoughts on that?

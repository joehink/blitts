Every once in a while, someone new will let me know that they read my blog every day. It is hard for me to imagine it, but when they tell me, I feel sparkley joy inside. I love sparkley joy. So today's sparkley joy has been brought to you by Jillian. I am blessed to call her family and a friend. Are you embarassed yet J ?

Thank you everyone for the joy you impart to me.

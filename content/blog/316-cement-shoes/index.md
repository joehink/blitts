I'ts 8:30. If I wasn't looking at the clock there is no way I would have known. This has been an incredibley long day. 9:00 isotope shot, 9:15 CT scan, 12:00 bone scan, 2:30 radiation treatment with a few xrays thrown in for fun. I slogged to each appointment like my shoes were made of cement...big giant blocks of cement. I felt like I was wrapped in a wet blanket all day.

The results of the bone scan come tomorrow....radiation treatment at 10:30.
Trick or treat? I'll take treat given a choice....I am a little heavy on the trick side.

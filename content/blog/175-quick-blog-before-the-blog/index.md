I have been married to Mr Gadget for almost 21 years. During those years of bliss we have accumulated 1,948 electrical cords. Each cord only fits one thing. Ok that's a lie..extension cords don't count....make that 1,944 cords that only fit one gadget each. Most of these gadgets we don't even own anymore OR they no longer work OR they are dead because for some reason we can't find the cord that charges them.
I love things that make my life easier...I HATE CORDS...but cords are what bring the things that make my life easier to life.....I still HATE cords...always will.

Thank you for listening...I am now able to move on.

I received this painting in the mail yesterday. It is from my niece in Illinois who is 10..... her name is Maddy. Little did she know that she is playing a very integral part in my recovery. With just that painting and her sweet note, I counted 1,545,377 cancer cells died. Thank you Maddy! What a special gift.

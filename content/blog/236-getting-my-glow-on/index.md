I am back on the road again today to start radiation treatment.....back on the road to Thomas Kincaid puzzles, back on the road to fatigue, purple felt pen art on random body parts, lockers that hold all your replacement parts, and "muzak" that only compounds the desire to get out of there as soon as you can.....in other words...I am going to get my "glow" on.

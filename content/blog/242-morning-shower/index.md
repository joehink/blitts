Have you ever stepped in the shower first thing in the morning, pulled the curtain and then yelled out "HELP ME"?
That is exactly what I did this morning.

**(make sure no one else is home before trying this prayer technique...someone might actually think you need help and run to your aid finding you naked and alone and trying to explain why you yelled out "HELP ME")

The side effects of the radiation to my jaw have now begun. The inside of my mouth feels like a MacDonald's lawsuit except that I didn't have any coffee at MacDonald's.
It just burns. 

Realizing that sometimes life is better through pharmaceuticals, I will be stopping by Walgreens today to pick up something for the raging inferno that is now my mouth.

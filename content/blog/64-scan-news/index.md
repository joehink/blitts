The news from my latest scan was not the news we hoped for. I will be starting more radiation soon. The Dr. has chosen to take me off the oral chemo as he believes it has stopped working. When I am through with the radiation I will begin a new form of chemotherapy. God willing, the cancer will be defenseless against it.

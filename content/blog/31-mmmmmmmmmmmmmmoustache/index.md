This morning was one of those mornings you want to somehow keep frozen in time. One of those moments you want to remember forever, one that changes the rest of time and eternity. Today my son shaved his moustache. Yes, I said his moustache. 
He has been growing this dark line of facial hair for the past few months and today he came to me and asked to shave it for the first time! So off we went to the bathroom mirror and he took care of it like a pro...like he was a moustache specialist.....then he ran his finger over the top of his lip and said, "that feels so weird."
This is a day that a mom starts thinking about when her 5 year old son puts shaving cream on his face for the first time and then scrapes it off with a popsicle stick. He wants to be a man....and wow my son is really becoming a man...faster than he wants I am sure...but he is handling it with amazing strength.

So "Moustache Joe" here's to you and your future...and everytime you shave may you remember what an amazing young man you are!

My husband runs a hardware store and lumber yard on Lopez Island and has for the past 10+ years...he loves his job...he is very good at what he does and he is a good man, loved by many on that crazy little island.

Five years ago, his then boss offered him an old car that needed work in lieu of a bonus....his heart jumped in his chest, his eyes popped, his palms began to sweat and a resounding "YES" came from somewhere deep within middle earth and out his mouth.

Since then, father and son have spent the last five years...give or take...painstakingly restoring this car to the last detail....the way it was on the showroom floor...no aftermarket trinkets....no fuzzy dice...no outrageous flames painted on the side...she has a simple beauty about her and that's all she needs....that and copious amounts of fuel.

Well...she had her coming out party a few weeks ago on the island from whence she came....there was much "ooooooooo-ing" and "aaaaaahhhhhhhh-ing" from his former boss.

After a few tears and some pictures for posterity he said, "Grandma would be so proud." 

As it turns out....this was her car...when she was done driving she sent it to be stored in her grandson's garage and for many years it sat...oh I am sure they let her out every now and again...the car not the Grandma....but her age was beginning to show....again, the car not the Grandma....

Where did Grandma live? Well funny you should ask.....the answer is, and I quote, "Grandma lived in Pasadena"...........

So there she is....the one owner car, owned by the little old lady from Pasadena...

Beauty lies in the true story doesn't it..........

Let me just start out by saying that this is not an x-ray of my spine. It looks very painful I must say. However, I did find out two days ago that I do have a fracture in my spine. A compression fracture and it is not pleasant. It has been very very unpleasant actually. 

Today I am going to have a MRI done of my spine. This may lead to other treatment.
I really wish I could come up with something "witty" to say...but for the most part I am just happy to be able to walk to my kitchen, make some coffee, sit at my computer and write to you. Really, I really am grateful for that.

It's 2:30 in the morning. Joe is in bed asleep. He asked if I would sleep in the twin bed across from him. Of course I said yes. It's been a long time since I have sat and listened to one of my "babies" sleep. I remember at first it was an anxious thing...."will they take another breath?" Then it was the sound of peace and rest. 
So tonight I sleep with anxiety draped over me like a blanket. The fluid on my lung did contain cancer cells. The cancer is now officially outside of my bones. Translation: not good.....
The Dr has put me on Tamoxafin and he is checking for it's effectiveness in 3 weeks....that's not a lot of time. 
Thank you all for your prayers.

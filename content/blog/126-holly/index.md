This is my other baby...or my babies momma and I am his momma and her momma...this is sounding kinda freaky. I got Holly as a baby. She was only 3 at the time. 
I love this girl. She has been my teacher, therapist and BFF. She loves long walks, tall grass, grain and pringles. She smells good to me all the time and I love the way she comes when I call and we hug and scratch and kiss and sniff and kiss some more.

Today Holly starts an adventure. She is going to a friends to learn some new things. I am so happy that she will finally be busy and challenged after a long long long hiatus. 
I am sad but not to terribly sad because I am going to see her in two days.
Goodbye my love....until Sunday.

Tomorrow I have another chest CT scan scheduled for 10 am. The doctor is again going to measure the fluid in my lung cavity to make sure the medicine is still working.
This is the fastest way to determine the drug's effectiveness evidently.

Then it is off to do lab work, then to talk to the Dr about the scan and the lab work, then into the Chemo room for a 90 minute IV that typically requires at least 3 attempts to stick that needle in my vein... but the record currently stands at 10....OUCH

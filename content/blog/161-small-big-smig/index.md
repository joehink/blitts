I have been looking at pictures of the earth tonight. I am not sure why I decided to google pictures of the earth...ok I'm sure, but I am just sort of embarassed about it. It was because I was feeling very small today. Not thin, not short, but small. But for the record I would like to be thin and a little less short. 

I looked at the earth and felt my smallness. Then I thought about the size of the earth knowing that there are other planets and stars a zillion times larger than earth and that made me feel even smaller. 

Then I began to think about the fact that all I have to do is one small thing and that can change the world forever. 

Not so small after all now huh? huh?

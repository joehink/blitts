Here is a little song I wrote this morning as I was getting ready. I thought in honor of Christmas I could borrow the tune from "Oh Christmas Tree"

No estrogen no estrogen
oh how I loathe no estrogen
No estrogen no estrogen
oh how I loathe no estrogen
My skin is dry as sand you see
my lips are cracking as we speak
No estrogen no estrogen
oh how I loathe no estrogen

WOW! Today's blog could go lots of directions....What do you think?... What do I think about it?... What were you thinking?!... What was I thinking?!... What made you think that?... What did you think was going to happen?

I'll tell you what I think...I think there is a lot to think about. Right now there are even things I don't want to think about. Not thinking about something is not always a good thing....It usually ends up with someone saying," You know, you really should have thought that through a little more."

Often times we think we are doing the right thing which is then followed by,"What in the world was I thinking?"

So now what do we do? I think.....we pray.

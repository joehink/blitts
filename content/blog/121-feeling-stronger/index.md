Am I right ladies? huh? Thought I could do you gals a favor while I write this second blog of the day.

After a few rounds of tears for everyone here, we are getting stronger. Everything is going to be ok. We have guidance, we have provision (enough for some summer fun. Big Huge thanks to G & P) we got plans for an awesome trip (thanks to United Air Miles) etc. Things are looking fine. Everything felt a little shaky at first, but we got it together.
Our future is looking good.
